This is a solution to the Java coursework set at my time at the University of Portsmouth. I have set a challenge to write the solution using a different programming langauge
as this would help me further polish my skills in this area. The language chosen is JavaScript and I am using the Bootstrap framework to create a form based UI with a customised shopping basket.

Please see the PDF document which sets out the scope of the task and all of the other files which meet its required specifications.

This was a fun project which challenged me to think about the most efficient way to meet the stakeholders needs and to satisfy all of the requirements.
