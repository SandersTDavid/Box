This is a solution to the Java coursework set in my time at the University of Portsmouth. 

Please see the PDF document which sets out the scope of the task and all of the other files which meet its required specifications.

I have set a challenge to write the solution using a different programming langauge as this would help me keep my skills fresh in this area. The language chosen is vanilla JavaScript and I am using the Bootstrap framework to create a form based UI with a customised shopping basket.

This was a fun project which challenged me to think about the most efficient way to meet the stakeholders needs and to satisfy all of the requirements using only plain vanilla javascript. It could have been quicker and easier to use a library such as jQuery but I wanted to stick with vanilla JavaScript to prove that it can be done without relying on this.
